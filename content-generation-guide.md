# Content Generation Guide: realtorsrelizabethtownky.com
## Addendum to Project Blueprint — Feed Both Documents to Claude Code

---

## MASTER INSTRUCTION FOR CLAUDE CODE

Generate ALL page content during build. Every page must be customer-facing, publish-ready, with real local data. No placeholder text, no "lorem ipsum", no "[insert here]" blocks. Every page should read like it was written by a local Elizabethtown real estate expert.

When generating content, Claude Code should web search for current, accurate local data for each page (home prices, school ratings, park amenities, business names, distances, etc.). Content must feel locally authoritative — reference specific street names, landmarks, local nicknames ("E-town"), and real businesses.

---

## GLOBAL CONTENT RULES

### Voice & Tone
- Authoritative local expert — not salesy, not generic
- Second person ("you") for guides and advice content
- Third person for directory listings and area descriptions
- Conversational but professional — imagine a knowledgeable friend who's also a realtor
- Use "E-town" occasionally as locals do
- Reference specific landmarks naturally (Freeman Lake, the Towne Mall corridor, Ring Road, I-65)

### SEO Writing Rules
- Primary keyword in H1, first 100 words, and last paragraph
- Secondary keywords sprinkled naturally through H2s and body
- No keyword stuffing — if it reads awkwardly, rewrite it
- Every page must have a unique meta title (under 60 chars) and meta description (under 160 chars)
- Use semantic variations (e.g., "realtors" / "real estate agents" / "agents" / "real estate professionals")

### CKG Integration Rules
- Every content page includes exactly ONE contextual CKG mention with internal link
- CKG mentions must feel natural — tied to the page topic
- Rotate anchor text (see blueprint for anchor text list)
- Fort Knox / military pages: always emphasize Austin Kutz's veteran status
- Never mention CKG more than twice on any non-CKG page (once in body, once in sidebar CTA)

### Formatting Standards
- Use H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections
- Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
- Include bulleted lists where they add clarity (amenities, steps, checklists)
- Bold key stats and data points on first mention
- Include a "Quick Facts" box at the top of neighborhood, school, and area pages
