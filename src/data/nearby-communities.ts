    metaDesc: "Guide to living in Hodgenville, KY — Abraham Lincoln's birthplace, 20 minutes from E-town. Affordable housing and rural Kentucky charm.",
    content: `<p>Hodgenville is a small LaRue County town of about <strong>3,200 residents</strong> located roughly <strong>20 minutes south</strong> of Elizabethtown via US-31E. It's best known as the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln — the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park draws visitors from around the world to the site of Lincoln's humble log cabin origins.</p>

<h2>Housing &amp; Real Estate</h2>
<p>Hodgenville offers some of the most affordable real estate in the region. Home prices typically range from <strong>$100,000 to $200,000</strong>, making homeownership accessible on almost any budget. The housing stock is primarily established homes with larger lots than you'd find in Elizabethtown proper. For buyers seeking acreage and rural character at rock-bottom prices, Hodgenville delivers.</p>

<h2>Community Character</h2>
<p>This is quintessential small-town Kentucky — a walkable town square, locally owned businesses, community events centered around the Lincoln heritage, and the kind of neighborly atmosphere that defines rural American life. The pace is deliberately slow, and residents prefer it that way.</p>

<h2>Schools</h2>
<p>Hodgenville is served by LaRue County Schools, a smaller district with a community-focused approach. The schools reflect the town's character — personal attention, strong community involvement, and a tight-knit school culture.</p>

<h2>Distance &amp; Commute</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>To Elizabethtown:</strong> ~20 minutes via US-31E</li>
<li><strong>To Fort Knox:</strong> ~35 minutes</li>
<li><strong>To Louisville:</strong> ~55-60 minutes via I-65</li>
</ul>
<p>The commute to E-town and Fort Knox is manageable but notably longer than from closer communities like <a href="/fort-knox/radcliff-ky/">Radcliff</a> or <a href="/fort-knox/vine-grove-ky/">Vine Grove</a>. Most residents accept the drive for the dramatically lower cost of living and rural lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Hodgenville</h2>
<p>Hodgenville is ideal for buyers who want <strong>maximum affordability, rural character, and a genuine small-town experience</strong>. It's a strong option for retirees, remote workers, and anyone who prioritizes space and quiet over proximity to commercial amenities.

    metaTitle: "Sonora KY Guide | Near Elizabethtown",
    metaDesc: "Guide to living in Sonora, KY — a small rural community 15 minutes south of Elizabethtown with very affordable housing on the LaRue County border.",
    content: `<p>Sonora is a tiny community on the southern edge of Hardin County, about <strong>15 minutes south</strong> of Elizabethtown. Straddling the Hardin-LaRue county line, this rural area offers the most affordable housing options in the greater E-town orbit. If your priorities are maximum square footage per dollar and a country setting, Sonora is worth a look.</p>

<h2>Housing &amp; Real Estate</h2>
<p>Sonora and the surrounding area feature some of the lowest home prices in the region, typically ranging from <strong>$100,000 to $200,000</strong>. You'll find established homes on generous lots, some properties with acreage, and the occasional new build. For investors, the low acquisition costs paired with steady regional demand make Sonora properties worth considering for rental income.</p>

<h2>Community Character</h2>
<p>This is deeply rural Kentucky. Sonora is a place where front porches are for sitting, fields outnumber storefronts, and the community is small enough that everyone looks out for each other. There are minimal commercial amenities locally — E-town provides everything you need, and it's just a short drive north.</p>

<h2>Schools</h2>
<p>Depending on exact location, students may attend either Hardin County Schools or LaRue County Schools. Verify the specific school district before purchasing, as the county line runs through the area. <a href="/elizabethtown/schools/hardin-county-schools/">Hardin County Schools</a> carry the Purple Star designation for military families.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>To Elizabethtown:</strong> ~15 minutes via US-31W or I-65</li>
<li><strong>To Fort Knox:</strong> ~30-35 minutes</li>
<li><strong>To Louisville:</strong> ~50 minutes via I-65</li>
</ul>
<p>The I-65 access near Sonora provides a direct route north to <a href="/elizabethtown/">Elizabethtown</a> and Louisville, making the commute more manageable than the rural setting might suggest.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Sonora</h2>
<p>Sonora is best for buyers who prioritize <strong>the lowest possible cost of living, rural acreage, and don't mind a longer commute</strong>. It's a strong choice for retirees on fixed incomes, remote workers, and budget-conscious families. For Fort Knox families, the commute is longer than ideal — but for those who value land and savings over convenience, it works. Explore closer <a href="/elizabethtown/neighborhoods/">E-town neighborhoods</a> if commute time is a priority.</p>
