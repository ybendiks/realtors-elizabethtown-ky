    overview: `Helmwood Heights is one of Elizabethtown's most established and beloved neighborhoods. Located in the northwest part of the city off Helmwood Road, this community of roughly 930 residents is known for its mature tree-lined streets, walkable sidewalks, and strong sense of neighborly connection. The subdivision was developed primarily in the 1970s and 1980s, giving it a settled, lived-in character that newer developments can't replicate. Families are drawn here for the quiet residential feel, convenient location near schools and shopping along North Dixie Highway, and the kind of neighborhood where kids still ride bikes on the street and neighbors know each other by name.`,
    housing: `Homes in Helmwood Heights are predominantly brick ranch-style and split-level designs, with some two-story colonials mixed in. Most homes sit on generous lots with established landscaping and mature trees that provide excellent shade in Kentucky's warm summers. Square footage typically ranges from 1,200 to 2,200 square feet, with three to four bedrooms being standard. The price range generally falls between **$180,000 and $280,000**, making Helmwood Heights an accessible entry point for first-time buyers and a solid value for families seeking an established neighborhood. Homes here tend to sell relatively quickly due to the area's reputation and school proximity.`,
    schools: `Helmwood Heights feeds into the Hardin County Schools district. The namesake Helmwood Heights Elementary sits right in the neighborhood, making morning drop-off a breeze for families with young children. Middle schoolers typically attend East Hardin Middle School, and high school students are zoned for Central Hardin High School in nearby Cecilia. All Hardin County schools carry the Purple Star designation for military-friendly practices, which is a significant plus for Fort Knox families considering this area.`,

Grocery stores, restaurants, and retail are all within five minutes. For outdoor recreation, Freeman Lake Park is roughly 10 minutes away, offering lakeside trails, playgrounds, and pavilions.

    commute: `Helmwood Heights offers a convenient commute in multiple directions. Fort Knox is about **15 minutes** north via US-31W, making it a practical choice for military families who want a bit more distance from post while staying close.

    bestFor: `Helmwood Heights is ideal for **families with school-age children** who want a walkable neighborhood with an elementary school right in the community. It's also a great fit for **military families** stationed at Fort Knox who want a 15-minute commute without living in Radcliff. **First-time homebuyers** will find the price point accessible, and **retirees** appreciate the quiet streets and established community feel. If you're looking for a neighborhood with character and convenience, Helmwood Heights delivers.`,

    overview: `Woodland Heights is one of Elizabethtown's older, more established neighborhoods, located in the central-west part of the city near Woodland Drive. Developed primarily in the 1960s and 1970s, this community offers larger lot sizes than many newer subdivisions, with mature hardwoods and well-established landscaping throughout. The neighborhood has a distinctly residential character — quiet streets, minimal through-traffic, and a sense of permanence that comes from decades of families putting down roots. Its central location makes it one of the most convenient areas in E-town for accessing schools, shopping, and downtown amenities.`,
    housing: `The housing stock in Woodland Heights consists mainly of brick ranch homes, cape cods, and some two-story colonials built between the 1960s and 1980s. Lot sizes are notably generous compared to newer E-town developments, often exceeding a quarter acre, which gives homeowners more yard space and privacy. Homes typically offer **1,400 to 2,400 square feet** with three to four bedrooms.

Many homes have been tastefully renovated while retaining their original character.`,
    schools: `Woodland Heights falls within the Elizabethtown Independent School District, one of the smaller and more focused districts in the area. This is a draw for families who prefer the tight-knit community feel of a smaller district.

The E-town Independent district is well-regarded for academic performance and individualized attention, with an enrollment of about 2,465 students across 8 schools.`,
    amenities: `The central location of Woodland Heights puts residents within a 5-minute drive of virtually everything E-town offers.

Freeman Lake Park is a short drive for outdoor recreation, and Pritchard Community Center offers programs and activities for residents of all ages.`,
    commute: `From Woodland Heights, the commute to Fort Knox takes approximately **18 minutes** via US-31W heading north. Louisville is about **45 minutes** via I-65, with convenient interstate access. The neighborhood's central position in E-town means that most local errands, schools, and workplaces are within a 10-minute drive. Ring Road and the North Dixie Highway corridor are both easily accessible from the neighborhood.`,
    bestFor: `Woodland Heights is an excellent choice for **families seeking the Elizabethtown Independent school district** without paying a premium. **First-time buyers** will find the price point attainable, and the larger lot sizes appeal to anyone who values outdoor space. The neighborhood is also well-suited for **retirees** who want a quiet, established area close to medical facilities, shopping, and downtown. **Military families** looking for a centrally located home with a reasonable Fort Knox commute will find Woodland Heights a practical option.`,

    overview: `The Ring Road area is the commercial and geographic heart of Elizabethtown, making it one of the most convenient places to live in the city. Ring Road itself is the main commercial artery — lined with restaurants, retailers, grocery stores, and service businesses — but the residential areas tucked just off this corridor offer surprisingly quiet living within walking distance of nearly everything. This is E-town's most central location, appealing to anyone who values being close to the action without the longer drives that outlying neighborhoods require.`,
    housing: `Housing in the Ring Road area is notably diverse, reflecting the area's long development history. You'll find everything from affordable condominiums and townhomes to established ranch homes and two-story family residences.

    schools: `Depending on exact location, Ring Road area homes may fall in either the Hardin County Schools or Elizabethtown Independent School District — so it's important to verify the specific attendance zone for any home you're considering.

Both districts offer quality education with the Purple Star designation for military family support.`,

Pritchard Community Center and its programs are easily accessible, and downtown E-town is just a few minutes away. The convenience factor here is unmatched among E-town neighborhoods.`,

Fort Knox is **15-20 minutes** north via US-31W, Louisville is about **45 minutes** via I-65, and the interstate on-ramp is close by.

    overview: `Downtown Elizabethtown offers a living experience unlike anywhere else in the city — walkable streets, historic architecture, locally owned shops and restaurants, and a genuine small-town Main Street vibe that can't be replicated in a subdivision. The downtown area stretches along North and South Main Street, centered around the Hardin County Courthouse and the town square. For anyone who values walkability, character, and community over cookie-cutter suburban living, downtown E-town is a hidden gem. This is where the city's history lives and where its future is being revitalized with new restaurants, events, and community investment.`,
    housing: `Downtown housing is eclectic and full of character. You'll find charming Craftsman bungalows from the early 1900s, stately colonial homes, and some converted commercial-to-residential spaces. Homes range from **$130,000 for smaller bungalows needing updates to $300,000** for fully renovated historic properties. Square footage varies widely, from cozy 900-square-foot cottages to spacious 2,500-square-foot historic homes. The appeal here isn't uniformity — it's character. Hardwood floors, built-in bookshelves, covered porches, and architectural details that modern builders don't replicate are the norm. Some homes may need updating, which represents opportunity for handy buyers and investors.`,
    schools: `Downtown falls squarely in the Elizabethtown Independent School District, which is one of the area's most attractive draws for families. Morningside Elementary and Elizabethtown High School both serve the downtown area. The smaller district (approximately 2,465 students across 8 schools) means more individualized attention and a close-knit school community that many parents prefer over larger county schools.`,
    amenities: `This is downtown's strongest selling point. Walk to locally owned restaurants, coffee shops, boutique stores, and community events. The town square hosts seasonal events, farmers markets, and festivals throughout the year. The Elizabethtown Tourism & Convention Bureau is based here, and the area has seen renewed investment in recent years. Pritchard Community Center is nearby for recreation and programming. Freeman Lake Park is a short drive away.`,
    commute: `Fort Knox is about **18 minutes** north of downtown via US-31W. Louisville is approximately **48 minutes** via I-65, with the interstate accessible within about 10 minutes from downtown. The central location means most E-town destinations are close by, though the historic street grid can mean slightly longer travel times to some east-side commercial areas compared to Ring Road neighborhoods. For most residents, the walkability of daily life more than compensates.`,
    bestFor: `Downtown E-town is perfect for **anyone who values walkability and character over subdivision uniformity**. **Young professionals** love the proximity to restaurants and nightlife. **Retirees** appreciate the ability to walk to shops and services. **Investors** will find renovation opportunities with strong rental potential, especially from ECTC students and young professionals. **History buffs and creative types** who want a home with soul rather than a home with a homeowner's association will feel right at home downtown.`,

    overview: `Foxwood is Elizabethtown's premier new development and the address of choice for buyers seeking luxury-level homes on spacious lots. Located off Lincoln Parkway on the south side of E-town, Foxwood offers something rare in the Elizabethtown market: one-acre-plus lots in a planned community with new construction from quality builders. This is where E-town's most ambitious residential real estate is happening right now, with custom homes that rival properties in much more expensive markets — at a fraction of the cost you'd pay in Louisville, Lexington, or Nashville.`,
    housing: `Foxwood is defined by its generous lot sizes — a minimum of one acre — and custom-built homes that range from thoughtfully designed ranch plans to expansive two-story residences exceeding 4,000 square feet. Prices start around **$350,000 and can exceed $600,000** for the largest custom builds. Four to six bedrooms, three-car garages, open-concept great rooms, gourmet kitchens, and luxury master suites are standard in this price range. Because most homes are custom or semi-custom builds, buyers often have the opportunity to select finishes, floor plans, and design details that match their exact preferences. Active builders include Ball Homes and other reputable regional builders.`,
    schools: `Foxwood is served by the Hardin County Schools district. Heartland Elementary and Central Hardin High School are the primary feeder schools. As the neighborhood matures and the area's population grows, school options in this zone may expand. The Purple Star district designation applies here as well, supporting military families who choose Foxwood for its space and quality.`,
    amenities: `The Lincoln Parkway corridor near Foxwood continues to develop commercially, bringing new restaurants, retail, and services to the south side of E-town. The one-acre lots mean that outdoor living — gardens, pools, outbuildings, and space for children and pets — is a core part of the Foxwood lifestyle. For centralized shopping and dining, the Ring Road corridor is a moderate drive north. The I-65 interchange is conveniently close, providing quick access to Louisville when needed.`,
    commute: `Fort Knox is approximately **22 minutes** from Foxwood via US-31W. Louisville is about **38 minutes** via I-65 — and the proximity to the interstate makes Foxwood one of the better-positioned E-town neighborhoods for Louisville commuters. The south-side location means the drive to downtown E-town and Ring Road is about 10-15 minutes, but the spacious lots and premium setting make the trade-off worthwhile for Foxwood residents.`,
    bestFor: `Foxwood is built for **buyers who want the best new construction Elizabethtown has to offer** — large lots, custom homes, and a premium living experience. **Senior military officers** (O-5 and above) and **senior warrant officers** with higher BAH rates can leverage their housing allowance to build real equity in a quality property. **Louisville commuters** who want space and value without Louisville prices will find Foxwood compelling. **Established families** seeking room to spread out, and **anyone dreaming of a custom home on an acre-plus lot**, should put Foxwood at the top of their list. It's where you get Nashville-quality living at Kentucky prices.`,
