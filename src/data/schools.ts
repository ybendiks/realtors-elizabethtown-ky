    overview: `Hardin County Schools is the largest public school district in the Elizabethtown area and one of the largest in Kentucky. Serving approximately 14,714 students across 28 schools, the district covers a broad geographic area that includes Elizabethtown, Cecilia, Radcliff, Vine Grove, and surrounding rural communities. The district operates 15 elementary schools, 5 middle schools, 4 high schools, and several alternative and specialized programs. Hardin County Schools has earned a reputation for consistent performance, strong extracurricular programs, and a genuine commitment to serving military-connected families from nearby Fort Knox. For families relocating to the Elizabethtown area, Hardin County Schools will likely be the district your children attend unless you live within the Elizabethtown city limits, which feeds into the smaller Elizabethtown Independent district. The district's size means a wide range of course offerings, robust athletic programs, and comprehensive support services that smaller districts sometimes cannot match.`,
    academics: `Hardin County Schools offers a comprehensive academic program from pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade. The district provides career and technical education pathways, dual credit partnerships with Elizabethtown Community and Technical College, and Advanced Placement courses across its high schools. Central Hardin High School and North Hardin High School both offer extensive AP course menus, while John Hardin High School has expanded its career and technical education offerings in recent years. At the elementary level, the district uses a standards-based curriculum aligned with Kentucky Academic Standards, and most elementary schools offer gifted and talented programming. Middle schools serve as a bridge with exploratory electives, team-based instruction, and early career awareness programs. The district also operates the Hardin County Schools Early College and Career Center, giving high school students the opportunity to earn college credits and industry certifications before graduation. Special education services are robust, with dedicated staff across all schools and specialized programs at Lincoln Trail Elementary and other campuses.`,
    military: `Hardin County Schools holds the Purple Star designation across all of its campuses, a recognition awarded to schools that demonstrate a strong commitment to supporting military-connected students and families. This is not a symbolic gesture — it reflects concrete policies and programs. Every school in the district has a designated military liaison who helps incoming families navigate enrollment, transfer credits, and connect with community resources. The district has streamlined enrollment procedures specifically designed for PCS families, allowing students to register and begin classes quickly even when paperwork from a previous duty station is still in transit. Hardin County Schools participates in the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children, which ensures that course placement, graduation requirements, and extracurricular eligibility are handled fairly for students who transfer between states. With Fort Knox located just minutes from many district schools, Hardin County has decades of experience serving military families and understands the unique challenges of frequent relocations, deployments, and reintegration. The district's School Liaison Officer works closely with Fort Knox to coordinate services and keep communication open between the installation and the school system.`,
    neighborhoods: `Hardin County Schools covers a large geographic area, and the specific school your child attends depends on your home address. Families living in **Pear Orchard** and the Ring Road corridor are typically zoned for Heartland Elementary and Central Hardin High School. Homes in **Helmwood Heights** feed into Helmwood Heights Elementary and Central Hardin High. The **Foxborough Estates** and **The Cedars** neighborhoods on the south side often zone to G.C. Burkhead Elementary and Central Hardin High. Families in **Radcliff** and areas near Fort Knox attend North Hardin or John Hardin High. If you are considering a home in the E-town area and school zoning is a priority, it is worth verifying the exact zoning with the district before making an offer, as boundaries can shift with enrollment changes.`,

    overview: `Elizabethtown Independent Schools is the smaller of the two public school districts serving the Elizabethtown area. With approximately 2,465 students spread across 8 schools, Elizabethtown Independent offers a more intimate, community-focused educational experience than the larger Hardin County system. The district serves families who live within the Elizabethtown city limits, encompassing some of the most established and desirable neighborhoods in the area. The district operates four elementary schools — Morningside, Helmwood Heights (not to be confused with the Hardin County school of similar name), T.K. Stone, and Panther Place — along with Elizabethtown Middle School and Elizabethtown High School. Families who choose to live within E-town Independent boundaries often cite the district's strong academic reputation, smaller class sizes, and the sense of community that comes from a district where administrators, teachers, and parents know each other personally. The district consistently performs well on Kentucky state assessments and has a graduation rate that exceeds the state average.`,
    academics: `Elizabethtown Independent Schools delivers a rigorous academic program that benefits from the district's smaller size. Teachers and administrators can give students more individualized attention, and the district has developed strong programs in both college preparatory and career readiness tracks. Elizabethtown High School offers Advanced Placement courses, dual credit opportunities through partnerships with local colleges, and a range of elective options that is impressive for a school of its size. At roughly 799 students, E-town High maintains a student-to-teacher ratio that allows for meaningful relationships between educators and students. The elementary schools emphasize foundational literacy and math skills, with intervention programs available for students who need additional support. Elizabethtown Middle School bridges the gap with team-based instruction, exploratory electives, and academic support programs. The district also provides gifted and talented services, special education programming, and English language learner support. Parents frequently praise the district's responsiveness and the ease of communicating directly with teachers and administrators — a benefit of being a smaller system where everyone is accessible.`,
    military: `While Elizabethtown Independent is a smaller district, it is well accustomed to serving military families. Many families stationed at Fort Knox choose to live within the E-town city limits specifically for access to this district, and the schools have developed practices that accommodate the unique needs of military-connected students. The district participates in the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children, ensuring smooth credit transfers, equitable course placement, and fair treatment of extracurricular eligibility for students arriving mid-year from other states. Teachers and counselors understand that military students may arrive at any point during the school year and work to integrate them quickly into both academic and social circles. The district does not carry the formal Purple Star designation that Hardin County Schools holds across all campuses, but the practical support for military families is strong. Fort Knox families who want the smaller-district experience combined with established neighborhoods and a short commute to post frequently find that E-town Independent offers the right balance.`,
    neighborhoods: `Elizabethtown Independent Schools draw from neighborhoods within the city limits of Elizabethtown. **Woodland Heights** is one of the most popular neighborhoods for families wanting this district, with its established homes, generous lots, and central location. The **Downtown** area feeds into E-town Independent and appeals to those who enjoy walkability and historic character. Portions of **Foxwood** and surrounding areas also fall within the district boundary. Because the boundary follows the city limits rather than a simple geographic zone, some homes that appear to be "in E-town" may actually fall in the Hardin County district. It is essential to verify the exact district boundary before purchasing if school assignment matters to your family.`,

    overview: `Central Hardin High School is the largest high school in the Hardin County Schools district, enrolling approximately 1,827 students in grades nine through twelve. Located in the community of Cecilia just south of Elizabethtown, Central Hardin serves students from a wide swath of the county, drawing from neighborhoods on the south and east sides of E-town as well as rural communities to the south and west. The school has a long history in the community and is known for strong athletic programs, an engaged student body, and a comprehensive academic offering that includes Advanced Placement courses, dual credit partnerships, and career and technical education pathways. Central Hardin's campus is modern and well-maintained, reflecting ongoing investment by the district. For families relocating to the Elizabethtown area who will live in the Pear Orchard, Helmwood Heights, Foxborough Estates, or Ring Road neighborhoods, Central Hardin High is likely where your high schooler will attend. The school carries the Hardin County Purple Star designation, signaling a commitment to supporting military-connected students.`,
    academics: `Central Hardin High School offers a broad academic program that serves its large and diverse student body well. The school provides a full menu of Advanced Placement courses including AP English, AP Calculus, AP Biology, AP U.S. History, and several others. Students can also take dual credit classes through partnerships with Elizabethtown Community and Technical College, earning both high school and college credit simultaneously. Career and technical education is a strong component of the Central Hardin experience, with pathways available in health sciences, engineering and technology, business, agriculture, and skilled trades. The school's career center helps students explore post-secondary options, whether that means a four-year university, community college, military service, or entering the workforce with an industry credential. Extracurricular academic programs include Academic Team, speech and debate, FBLA, and various STEM clubs. Central Hardin regularly sends graduates to the University of Kentucky, Western Kentucky University, University of Louisville, and colleges across the country. The school also has a robust special education department and support services for students with individualized education plans.`,
    military: `As a Purple Star designated school within the Hardin County district, Central Hardin High School has established protocols specifically designed to support students from military families. The school enrolls a significant number of students whose parents serve at Fort Knox, and the staff understands the realities of military life — including mid-year transfers, parental deployments, and the social challenges of frequent moves. A military family liaison is available to help new students with enrollment, course placement, and connecting with extracurricular activities. Central Hardin participates in the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children, which protects transferring students from losing academic credit or being unfairly penalized during school transitions. The JROTC program at Central Hardin provides a familiar environment for students who may have participated in similar programs at previous duty stations. Coaches and activity sponsors are generally accommodating of military-related absences and understand the importance of helping military-connected students feel welcome quickly.`,
    neighborhoods: `Central Hardin High School draws students from several of Elizabethtown's most popular neighborhoods. Families in **Pear Orchard** are zoned for Central Hardin, as are those in **Helmwood Heights**, **Foxborough Estates**, and the **Ring Road** area. The **Cedars** and **Thousand Oaks** neighborhoods also typically feed into Central Hardin. The school's location in Cecilia means a short drive from south Elizabethtown — typically 10 to 15 minutes depending on the specific neighborhood. For families looking at homes specifically to attend Central Hardin, the south and east quadrants of Elizabethtown offer the most options across a range of price points.`,

    overview: `John Hardin High School serves students in the Radcliff area and surrounding communities, enrolling approximately 1,200 students in grades nine through twelve. Located in Radcliff just south of the Fort Knox gate, John Hardin draws a significant portion of its student body from military families, giving the school a uniquely diverse and transient population that reflects the broader military community. The school is part of the Hardin County Schools district and carries the Purple Star designation for military-friendly practices. John Hardin has built a strong identity around its JROTC program, which is one of the most active and decorated in the region. The school also offers a solid academic foundation with AP courses, career and technical education pathways, and dual credit options. For families stationed at Fort Knox who choose to live in Radcliff or the surrounding off-post communities, John Hardin High School will be the likely high school assignment. The school's proximity to post and its deep experience with military families make it a comfortable landing spot for students who have moved multiple times.`,
    academics: `John Hardin High School provides a well-rounded academic program that balances college preparatory coursework with career readiness. The school offers Advanced Placement courses in core subject areas, dual credit partnerships with Elizabethtown Community and Technical College, and career and technical education pathways in fields like health sciences, information technology, manufacturing, and automotive technology. The school's vocational programs are a particular strength, with students gaining hands-on experience and industry certifications before graduation. Academically, John Hardin has worked to improve performance metrics in recent years, with targeted initiatives in literacy and math proficiency. The school provides comprehensive support services including tutoring, academic counseling, and credit recovery programs for students who need to make up coursework — a common need for military-connected students who may arrive with credits that do not align perfectly with Kentucky requirements. John Hardin's Academic Team, FBLA, and STEM-related clubs offer enrichment opportunities beyond the classroom, and the school's arts program includes band, choir, and visual arts.`,
    military: `John Hardin High School may have the strongest military connection of any high school in the Hardin County system. A significant percentage of the student body has at least one parent serving at Fort Knox, and the school's culture reflects this military influence in positive ways. The JROTC program at John Hardin is widely regarded as one of the best in Kentucky, with cadets regularly competing at regional and national levels in drill, academic competitions, and physical fitness events. Many John Hardin students go on to enlist in the military or attend service academies and ROTC programs at universities. The school's Purple Star designation is backed by real, day-to-day support: a military family liaison coordinates enrollment and transition assistance, teachers are trained to recognize and respond to deployment-related stress in students, and the school calendar accommodates military events and ceremonies. For a military family PCSing to Fort Knox, John Hardin offers the comfort of being surrounded by peers who understand the military lifestyle — a factor that can make a significant difference in a teenager's adjustment to a new duty station.`,
    neighborhoods: `John Hardin High School draws primarily from Radcliff and the communities immediately south and east of Fort Knox. While the Radcliff area offers a range of housing options, families looking for homes specifically in the John Hardin zone will find options ranging from established ranch-style neighborhoods to newer construction developments. The commute from most Radcliff neighborhoods to John Hardin is short — typically under 10 minutes. Families who prefer to live in Elizabethtown proper while still having access to the military community often look at neighborhoods on E-town's north side, though these typically zone for Central Hardin or North Hardin instead. For those specifically wanting the John Hardin experience, Radcliff is the primary community.`,

    overview: `Elizabethtown High School is the sole high school in the Elizabethtown Independent School District, serving approximately 799 students in grades nine through twelve. Located in downtown Elizabethtown, the school benefits from the tight-knit character of the independent district, where students, teachers, administrators, and families form close connections over the course of a student's academic career. E-town High is considerably smaller than the Hardin County high schools, and this size is widely viewed as an advantage by families who prioritize individualized attention and a strong sense of school community. The Panthers compete in KHSAA athletics and have a proud tradition in basketball, football, baseball, and other sports. Academically, E-town High punches above its weight, offering a curriculum that includes Advanced Placement courses, dual credit options, and a range of electives that rival schools twice its size. For families living within the Elizabethtown city limits — in neighborhoods like Woodland Heights, Downtown, and portions of Foxwood — E-town High is where your student will attend.`,
    academics: `Despite its smaller enrollment, Elizabethtown High School offers a strong and varied academic program. Advanced Placement courses are available in English, math, science, and social studies, and students can take dual credit courses through local college partnerships. The school's smaller size means that students are not just a number — teachers know their students by name, and academic counselors can provide more personalized guidance on college applications, scholarship searches, and career planning. E-town High consistently posts graduation rates above the Kentucky state average, and a healthy percentage of graduates pursue four-year degrees. Career and technical education options include business, health sciences, and technology pathways. The school's extracurricular academic offerings are robust for its size, with Academic Team, speech and debate, and various clubs providing enrichment opportunities. The school also offers comprehensive special education services and has a reputation for being responsive to parents' concerns and proactive in addressing students' needs. Students at E-town High often describe a family-like atmosphere that fosters both academic achievement and personal growth.`,
    military: `Elizabethtown High School serves a smaller number of military families compared to the Hardin County high schools, but the school is well-equipped to support students from Fort Knox families. The Elizabethtown Independent district participates in the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children, ensuring that students transferring from out-of-state schools receive fair treatment regarding credits, course placement, and extracurricular eligibility. The smaller school environment can actually be an advantage for military students, as it is easier to form connections and find a social group in a school of 799 than in a school of 1,800. Teachers and counselors are attentive to new students and make deliberate efforts to help them acclimate. The school does not have a formal JROTC program, but military-connected students who want that experience can often access programs through partnership arrangements or community organizations. Families from Fort Knox who choose to live within the E-town Independent boundary often do so precisely because they want the smaller, more personal school experience for their children.`,
    neighborhoods: `Elizabethtown High School serves students living within the Elizabethtown city limits, which includes several of the area's most established neighborhoods. **Woodland Heights** is a particularly popular choice for E-town High families, offering affordable homes on generous lots with a central location. The **Downtown** area provides walkability and historic charm, and some students can walk or bike to school. Portions of **Foxwood** also feed into the E-town Independent system. Families considering this school should verify that their prospective home falls within the district boundary, as homes just outside the city limit may be zoned for Hardin County Schools instead. Working with a knowledgeable local agent who understands these boundaries is essential.`,

    overview: `North Hardin High School is located in Radcliff, Kentucky, and is the Hardin County Schools campus closest to the gates of Fort Knox. Enrolling approximately 1,500 students in grades nine through twelve, North Hardin serves a diverse student population that includes a large percentage of military-connected families. The school's proximity to Fort Knox has shaped its character and culture, creating an environment that is welcoming to families from all over the country and around the world. North Hardin competes in KHSAA athletics and has a particularly strong tradition in basketball and track, with Trojan athletes regularly advancing to state-level competition. The school offers a comprehensive academic program with AP courses, career and technical pathways, and dual credit opportunities. As a Purple Star designated school, North Hardin has formalized its commitment to supporting military students through trained staff, streamlined enrollment, and a military family liaison who serves as a single point of contact for incoming families. For military families living in Radcliff or the north side of Elizabethtown, North Hardin High is a common school assignment.`,
    academics: `North Hardin High School delivers a broad academic program designed to serve its large, diverse student body. Advanced Placement courses are available across core subjects, and the school maintains dual credit partnerships with Elizabethtown Community and Technical College. Career and technical education pathways are well-developed at North Hardin, with options in health sciences, engineering, information technology, and skilled trades. The school has invested in modernizing its CTE facilities, giving students access to current equipment and technology in their chosen pathway. North Hardin also offers a strong arts program, with band, choir, theater, and visual arts enriching the student experience beyond core academics. Academically, the school has focused on improving literacy and math outcomes, with support programs including tutoring, credit recovery, and targeted intervention for students who are not meeting grade-level benchmarks. The school's guidance office provides college and career counseling, military enlistment support, and scholarship guidance. North Hardin graduates pursue a wide range of post-secondary paths, including four-year universities, community colleges, military service, and the workforce.`,
    military: `Of all the high schools in Hardin County, North Hardin arguably has the deepest military ties. Its location just outside the Fort Knox gates means that a substantial portion of the student body turns over every year as families PCS in and out of the installation. This high turnover rate has forced the school to become exceptionally good at integrating new students quickly, and the staff has developed a well-oiled system for welcoming arrivals, processing transcript evaluations, and placing students in appropriate courses — often within the first day or two. North Hardin's JROTC program is strong and active, providing military-connected students with a familiar program and peer group. The school's Purple Star designation reflects systemic support: military family liaisons, deployment support resources, and counselor training on military-specific issues like frequent relocation stress, parental deployment anxiety, and reintegration challenges. Students at North Hardin benefit from being surrounded by peers who understand the military lifestyle, which can ease the social transition that often accompanies a PCS move. The school also coordinates closely with the Fort Knox School Liaison Officer to ensure that communication between the installation and the school system is open and responsive.`,
    neighborhoods: `North Hardin High School draws students from Radcliff and the northern portions of the Hardin County school district. Families living in the Radcliff area have a range of housing options, from older established neighborhoods to newer developments. Some families who live on the north side of Elizabethtown may also be zoned for North Hardin, depending on the specific address. The commute from most Radcliff neighborhoods to North Hardin is very short, often under 10 minutes. Families who want proximity to Fort Knox while maintaining access to Elizabethtown's shopping and amenities often find that the Radcliff-North Hardin area strikes the right balance between convenience to post and quality of life off-post.`,

The school's location makes it a natural fit for families who want newer homes, convenient shopping access, and a well-regarded elementary school all in the same part of town. The neighborhoods around Heartland tend to offer homes in the $200,000 to $350,000 range, with a mix of established subdivisions and newer construction.`,

    overview: `Helmwood Heights Elementary School is a Hardin County Schools campus located right in the heart of the Helmwood Heights neighborhood in northwest Elizabethtown. Serving approximately 307 students in kindergarten through fifth grade, this is one of the smaller elementary schools in the Hardin County system, and its size is considered an advantage by families who value a close-knit school community. The school's location within the neighborhood means that many students can walk to school, a rarity in the E-town area that adds to the community feel of both the school and the surrounding streets. Helmwood Heights Elementary feeds into East Hardin Middle School and Central Hardin High School. The school carries the Hardin County Purple Star designation for military-friendly policies, which is relevant for Fort Knox families who choose to live in the Helmwood Heights area. Parents consistently describe Helmwood Heights Elementary as a warm, welcoming school where teachers know every student by name and families feel genuinely connected to the school community.`,
    academics: `Helmwood Heights Elementary delivers a comprehensive K-5 program aligned with Kentucky Academic Standards. The school's smaller enrollment — roughly 307 students — translates to smaller class sizes and more individualized attention for each student. Teachers at Helmwood Heights are known for building strong relationships with their students and families, and the school's culture emphasizes both academic achievement and character development. The curriculum covers foundational literacy, math, science, and social studies, with enrichment in art, music, physical education, and library skills. The school provides intervention services for students who need additional academic support, as well as gifted and talented programming for students who demonstrate advanced abilities.

    military: `Helmwood Heights Elementary, as a Purple Star school in the Hardin County district, provides structured support for military-connected students and families. A military family liaison assists with enrollment, orientation, and connecting new families with resources. The school participates in the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children, protecting military students from enrollment barriers and ensuring fair treatment of transferred academic credits. The school's smaller size is a particular advantage for military families — children who arrive mid-year find it easier to make friends and feel at home in a school where the student body is intimate and teachers are attentive to new arrivals. The school counselor is available to support students dealing with deployment-related stress, and the staff is experienced in recognizing the emotional needs of children from military homes. Fort Knox is approximately 15 minutes from the Helmwood Heights neighborhood, making this school a practical option for military families who want to live in an established E-town neighborhood with a short commute to post.`,
    neighborhoods: `Helmwood Heights Elementary is uniquely situated within the **Helmwood Heights** neighborhood itself, making it one of the few neighborhood schools in the E-town area where students can walk to class. Families living in Helmwood Heights are the primary attendees, though the school also draws from some surrounding areas in northwest Elizabethtown. The neighborhood features established brick ranch and split-level homes on generous lots with mature trees, priced generally between $180,000 and $280,000. The walkable school access, combined with the neighborhood's proximity to North Dixie Highway shopping and a 15-minute Fort Knox commute, makes the Helmwood Heights area a popular choice for families who want an affordable, community-oriented place to raise children.`,

    overview: `Fort Knox is home to Department of Defense Education Activity schools, commonly known as DoDEA schools, which serve the children of military service members and eligible Department of Defense civilians living or working on the installation. DoDEA schools are operated by the U.S. Department of Defense rather than the state of Kentucky, meaning they follow a separate curriculum, assessment system, and school calendar from the surrounding public school districts. The primary campus on Fort Knox is Kingsolver Elementary School, which serves students in the elementary grades. DoDEA school availability at Fort Knox has shifted over the years as installation populations have changed following BRAC realignments and force restructuring. Families should verify the current grade-level availability with the Fort Knox School Liaison Officer, as offerings can change based on enrollment numbers and DoD funding decisions. For families who prefer to keep their children in the DoD school system — particularly those who have moved frequently and want curriculum continuity — Fort Knox DoDEA schools provide a familiar environment that aligns with DoDEA schools at other installations worldwide.`,
    academics: `DoDEA schools follow a standardized curriculum developed by the Department of Defense Education Activity, which is designed to provide consistency for military families who move frequently between installations. This means that a student transferring from a DoDEA school at Fort Bragg, Ramstein, or Camp Humphreys to Fort Knox will find the same academic framework and instructional standards. DoDEA's curriculum is generally well-regarded, with a focus on college and career readiness, STEM integration, and 21st-century skills. Class sizes in DoDEA schools tend to be smaller than many public school systems, and schools benefit from dedicated funding for instructional resources and technology. Teachers in the DoDEA system are federal employees, and positions are competitive, which tends to attract experienced educators. The assessment system differs from Kentucky's state testing — DoDEA students take the DoDEA standardized assessments rather than Kentucky Summative Assessments. For families weighing DoDEA against the local public options, the key advantages of DoDEA are curriculum continuity during future PCS moves and the convenience of on-post location. The key trade-off is that DoDEA enrollment is limited to eligible families, and the range of extracurricular and athletic opportunities may be smaller than what the larger county schools offer.`,
    military: `DoDEA schools are built from the ground up for military families — this is not a civilian school system that accommodates military students; it is a school system whose entire purpose is serving them. Every aspect of the DoDEA experience reflects an understanding of military life: the school calendar aligns with common PCS timelines, teachers are trained to support children through deployments and reintegration, and the student body is entirely composed of military-connected peers who share the same experiences. Enrollment is straightforward for eligible families and handled through the on-post school registration office. There is no need to navigate Kentucky's Interstate Compact provisions because DoDEA operates outside the state system. For families who have been in the DoDEA system at previous duty stations and prefer continuity, Fort Knox's DoDEA schools allow children to continue in the same educational framework. However, families should be aware that not all grade levels may be served on-post at any given time. When on-post options do not cover your child's grade level, students attend off-post schools in the Hardin County or Elizabethtown Independent districts. The Fort Knox School Liaison Officer is the best resource for understanding current enrollment availability and making the right decision for your family.`,
    neighborhoods: `Families whose children attend Fort Knox DoDEA schools typically live on-post in installation housing. Fort Knox offers family housing in several on-post neighborhoods managed by Lendlease, with homes ranging from townhouses to single-family detached units. Living on-post means a very short commute to school — often walkable — and access to on-post amenities including the commissary, PX, fitness centers, and recreational facilities. Some families who initially live on-post later transition to off-post housing in Elizabethtown or Radcliff neighborhoods while continuing to attend DoDEA schools, if eligible and if seats are available. For families considering the transition to off-post housing, popular neighborhoods include **Helmwood Heights** with its 15-minute Fort Knox commute, **Pear Orchard** with newer homes and excellent shopping, and the **Ring Road** corridor for convenience. Note that moving off-post may affect DoDEA eligibility depending on current policies — check with the School Liaison Officer before making housing decisions.`,
